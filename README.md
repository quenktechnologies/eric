# Eric

CLI tool for generating projects from templates.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @quenk/eric -g

```

```Usage

In order to generate your project boilerplate, you must first create a template.

There is currently no documentation on creating templates but you can use
[this](https://github.com/quenktechnologies/eric-skeleton-tendril) template to get a rough idea.

On the CLI excecute:

```sh
eric get https://github.com/quenktechnologies/eric-skeleton-tendril
```

Provided you have git installed, that repo should be cloned and made 
available for your use.

Consider this script in early alpha. Use at your own risk.
